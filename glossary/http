<h1>What is HTTP?</h1>

<p class="glossary-intro">HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) is the protocol used by the World Wide Web determining how messages are formatted, transmitted and received.</p>

<p>When you type a url into your browser, you're effectively sending a command to a web server asking it to fetch and transmit the corresponding web page to you. HTTP is the framework within which this happens.</p>

<h2>What is HTTPS?</h2>

<p>HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is basically a secure version of HTTP. It's more secure as communications between a user's browser and the website are encrypted. HTTPS is common in webpages on which transactions occur, such as online banking websites, however, it is becoming the standard for all websites. Google have promoted its use and stated that HTTPS is taken into account in their ranking algorithm.</p>

<h3>How do you get an HTTPS website?</h3>

<p>Implementing HTTPS requires that you have your own dedicated IP address. You then need to buy, activate and install an SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) certificate to encrypt communications.</p>

<h2>HTTP error codes</h2>

<p>There are a number of <a href="https://tommccallumseo.github.io/glossary/http-status-code">http status codes</a> that appear if something goes wrong with the HTTP. SEOs should learn these as they are useful for highlighting problems:</p>

<h2>Informational codes</h2>
