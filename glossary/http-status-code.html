<h1>What is an HTTP status code?</h1>                                                                                                                

<p class="glossary-intro">An <dfn><abbr>HTTP</abbr> status code</dfn> is a response from a server which identifies the reason why a webpage did or did not not load properly.</p>
The most commonly known status code is probably a 404, indicating that the requested page can not be found and serving a page that lets the user know. 404 response pages are often customised, such as this error page from Airbnb.</h1>

<p>HTTP status codes are also commonly referred to as browser error codes or internet error codes.</p>


<h2>HTTP status code groups</h2>

<p><strong>1xx – </strong>This group states that the server has received the request and is continuing the process. Servers won't send a 1xx response to clients except occasionally under experimental conditions.</p>

<p><strong>2xx – </strong>The 2xx group is generally good news. This group indicates that the server has accepted, understood and processed the request.</p>

<p><strong>3xx – </strong>This group indicates that the user request needs redirected to another resource.</p>

<p><strong>4xx – </strong>This group of HTTP status codes generally indicate client-side errors – human errors where the web user has made a mistake. For example, by requesting a page that doesn't exist, perhaps because of a typo in the url, or where a request for a webpage cannot be honoured for some other reason.</p>

<p><strong>5xx – </strong>This group indicates a server error. An apparently valid request failed to receive a response. The server usually sends a message to indicate whether this is a temporary or permanent error.</p>

<h2>A list of all the HTTP status codes</h2>

<h3>1xx</h3>

<p><strong>100 Continue – </strong>The server has received the request and is processing it as normal with nothing amiss so far. The client should continue to send the remainder of the request.</p>

<p><strong>101 Switching Protocols –</strong> The client request has asked the server to use a different protocol but the server will only do so if it advantageous. For example, upgrading from an outdated HTTP protocol to the latest version.</p>

<p><strong>102 Processing (WebDAV) – </strong>The server has received the request but the response is not yet available. This can be used to prevent the client  timing out under the assumption the request was lost.</p>

<h3>2xx</h3>

<p><strong>200 OK –</strong> This is the standard response from HTTP servers when the client request has been acted upon successfully. In a GET request, the server will respond with the requested resource, in the case of a POST request, the response will contain an entity describing or containing the result of the action.</p>

<p><strong>201 Created – </strong>The request has been fulfilled and a new resource has been created.</p>

<p><strong>202 Accepted – </strong>The request has been accepted but is still being processed. A 202 response, however,  does not promise the request will be delivered on when processing is complete, or even that processing will be completed.</p>

<p><strong>203 Non Authoritative Information – </strong>The server is returning a modified version of the original response.</p>

<p><strong>204 No Content – </strong>Everything's fine with the request and response but there's no content to return.</p>

<p><strong>205 Reset Content – </strong>Same as a 204 except that the client must reset the document view.</p>

<p><strong>206 Partial Content – </strong>The server is only delivering part of the resource as specified by the client.</p>

<p><strong>207 Multi-status – </strong>The message body is an <a title="XML" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML">XML</a> message and can contain a number of response codes, depending on how many sub-requests were made.</p>

<p><strong>208 Already Reported – </strong>Used inside a <a href="http://www.webdav.org/other/faq.html">DAV</a> to avoid enumerating multiple members repeatedly.</p>

<p><strong>226 IM Used – </strong>The response includes Instance Manipulation, meaning the original response has been modified.</p>

<h3>3xx</h3>

<p><strong>300 Multiple Choices – </strong>There are multiple resources available – for example, different video formats – from which the client must choose.</p>

<p><strong>301 Moved Permanently – </strong>This and all other requests must be redirected to the given URI.</p>

<p><strong>302 Found – </strong>The client request should be redirected temporarily, the original URI will be restored.</p>

<p><strong>303 See Other – </strong>The response can be found under another URI.</p>

<p><strong>304 Not Modified –</strong> The requested resource has not been modified since the last time the user requested it so does not need to be transmitted again.</p>

<p><strong>305 Use Proxy – </strong>The requested resource is only available through a specified proxy. Many browsers deliberately don't handle this request for security reasons.</p>

<p><strong>306 Switch Proxy –</strong> This status code is no longer in use. It used to mean that subsequent requests should go via the specified proxy.</p>

<p><strong>307 Temporary Redirect – </strong>The request should redirect to another URI, but subsequent requests should use the original URI.</p>

<p><strong>308 Permanent Redirect – </strong>This request and all subsequent requests should redirect to a specified URI. 308 is not the same as a 301 as it does not allow the HTTP method to change.</p>

<h3>4xx</h3>

<p><strong>400 Bad Request –</strong> The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, too large size, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing.</p>

<p><strong>401 Unauthorised –</strong> The user needs permission to access the page but the required authentication has not been provided or the IP address has been banned.</p>

<p><strong>402  Payment Required – </strong>This code was very much looking ahead to a system of digital cash and micropayments for using certain websites which has not been adopted as yet. As a result, this code is not often used. Some websites do use 402s to indicate the user has exceeded the maximum number of requests allowed in a certain time period.</p>

<p><strong>403 Forbidden –</strong> The user request was valid but the server is doing it's best to ignore it. A reason migt be that the user is logged in but doesn't have the permissions needed to accesss resource.</p>

<p><strong>404 Not Found –</strong> A real classic.  The requested resource is not available at the moment of request - but that's not to say that there won't be something here in the future.</p>

<p><strong>405 Method Not Allowed – </strong>The method used to request a resource is not supported. This code is often associated with forms.</p>

<p><strong>406 Not Acceptable – </strong>The server can't send data that was requested. This could be an image that the '<a href="https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec14.html">Accept header</a>' of the request has specified as unacceptable, for example, an image in a certain file format.</p>

<p><strong>407 Proxy Authentication Required</strong> – The resource is not available until the client authenticates itself with the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server">proxy server</a>.</p>

<p><strong>408 Request Time-out – </strong>The server timed out waiting for the request from the client. The request can be repeated without changes at a later time.</p>

<p><strong>409 Conflict</strong> – The request could not be processed because of conflict in the request. An example would be an edit conflict between multiple simultaneous updates.</p>

<p><strong>410 Gone</strong> – Indicates that the resource requested has gone and will not be coming back. This code should be used when a webpage has been removed forever. The resource should be removed, or in techy terms, purged. A 410 is very similar to a 404 except, unlike a 404, the client shouldn't request the resource in the future. Search engines coming across a 410 status code should remove the resource from their index.</p>

<p><strong>411 Length Required – </strong>The request did not specify the length of its content so the server refuses to accept it. A valid content length header field needs to be added for the client to successfully repeat the request.</p>

<p><strong>412 Precondition Failed</strong> – The server does not meet one of the preconditions that was requested.</p>

<p><strong>413 Payload Too Large</strong> – The request is too large for the server to process.<sup id="cite_ref-44" class="reference"></sup></p>

<p><strong>414 URI Too Long –</strong> The Uniform Resource Identifier (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URI">URI</a>), which is the string of characters used to identify a resource, provided was too long for the server to process. Often the result of too much data being encoded as a query-string of a GET request, in which case it should be converted to a POST request. The most common type of URI is a Uniform Resource Locater, commonly URL, which is often referred to simply as a web address.</p>

<p><strong>415 Unsupported Media Type –</strong> The request entity has a media type which the server or resource does not support. For example, the client uploads an image in a format that is not used or recognised by the server.</p>

<p><strong>416 Range Not Satisfiable</strong> – The client has asked for a portion of the file but the server can't supply it.<sup id="cite_ref-48" class="reference"></sup></p>

<p><strong>417 Expectation Failed – </strong>The server cannot meet the requirements of the Expect request-header field sent by the client.</p>

<p><strong>418 I'm a Teapot –</strong> This code was introduced in 1998 as one of the traditional <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force">IETF</a> <a class="mw-redirect" title="April Fools' Day RFC" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/April_Fools%27_Day_RFC">April Fools' jokes</a> in association with the <em><a title="Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper_Text_Coffee_Pot_Control_Protocol">Hyper Text Coffee Pot Control Protocol.</a></em>It's not expected to be implemented by actual HTTP servers. The 418 code should be returned by teapots requested to brew coffee.</p>

<p><span id="421"></span><strong>421 Misdirected Request –</strong> The request was directed at a server that is unable to provide a response.</p>

<p><span id="422"></span><strong>422 Unprocessable Entity</strong> <strong>– </strong>There's nothing wrong with the request adn the server understands the content type and syntax, but it was unable to be followed due to semantic errors.</p>

<p><span id="423"></span><strong>423 Locked –</strong> The requested resource is locked.</p>

<p><strong>424 Failed Dependency –</strong> The current request failed due to failure of a previous request.</a></p>

<p><strong>426 Upgrade Required –</strong> The client should switch to a different protocol in order to conform to the standard defined by the latest <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/rfc/index">RFC</a> publication.</a>

<p><strong>428 Precondition Required –</strong> The origin server requires the request to be conditional.</p>

<p><strong>429 Too Many Requests –</strong> The user has sent too many requests in a given amount of time. There may be a time period that the user has to wait before trying again.</p>

<p><strong>431 Request Header Fields Too Large –</strong> The server refuses to process the request because an individual header field, or all the header fields collectively, are too large.</p>

<p><strong>451 Unavailable For Legal Reasons – </strong>The server has been legally demanded to deny access to a resource or to a set of resources that includes the requested resource. The code 451 was chosen as a reference to the Ray Bradbury novel, Fahrenheit 451.</p>

<h3>5xx</h3>

<p><strong>500 Internal Server Error – </strong>A generic message indicating an error but offering little more information, probably because there is no more information available.</p>

<p><strong>501 Not Implemented – </strong>The request was not completed as the server did not support the required functionality.</p>

<p><strong>502 Bad Gateway – </strong>The upstream server gave an invalid response and the request was not completed.</p>

<p><strong>503 Service Unavailable –</strong> The server is temporarily down, possibly due to being overloaded, and the request cannot be completed.</p>

<p><strong>504 Gateway Timeout – </strong>The server did not respond to the request in a reasonable timeframe and is not going to complete the request.</p>

<p><strong>505 HTTP Version Not Supported –</strong> The server does not support the HTTP protocol version.</p>
